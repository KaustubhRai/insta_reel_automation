EXPERIMENTAL and still bare bones 

i hate insta's algorithm of showing reels, so to either confuse the algorithm or some absolute disgust of what i just saw in a reel. instead of clicking 4-5 times and not getting such recommendations, i tried implementing it into a single click. 

It adds a custom "Action" button to the page, which when clicked, performs the following steps:

- Clicks the three-dot menu icon on an Instagram post.
- Selects the "Report" option from the menu.
- Selects the "It's spam" option from the report dialog.
- Closes the confirmation dialog.
- (will add in future if i remember)block the account

## Features
Automatically adds an "Action" button to Instagram posts.
Automates the process of reporting a post as spam

## Installation
- Download the repo, unzip it and navigate to the Extensions page of your browser
- Enable "Developer mode" and Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing the extension's source code.
